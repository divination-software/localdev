## One-"click" install script for Divination

1. `chmod +x *.sh`
1. `bash init.sh`

Utility scripts have been included to switch between the cloned copies of server
and sim and your own local copies of server and sim. This allows you to pull a
clean development environment down to play with, then swap in your copy of
server and/or sim for feature testing.

- `use-local-server.sh`
- `use-remote-server.sh`
- `use-local-sim.sh`
- `use-remote-sim.sh`

These commands assume this repository was cloned to the same parent directory as
your local copies of server and sim.
